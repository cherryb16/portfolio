## Why I Build

My best work happens at the seams between data and human experience. I love sitting with operators, counselors, or sales reps, learning how they actually get work done, and then shaping tools that remove friction. That curiosity has taken me from consulting on revenue intelligence and HR analytics to prototyping community resource navigators and shipping logistics playbooks.
