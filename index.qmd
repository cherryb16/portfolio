## Recent Highlights

## How I Work

- **Obsess over clarity**: I start with the decision to be made, then craft the dashboards, workflows, or UX needed to make it obvious
- **Prototype in the open**: Stakeholders see progress earlyâ€”whether it's a FigJam map, Firebase build, or ops playbook
- **Ground strategy in operations**: Field time with users, associates, and managers shapes every roadmap and metric
