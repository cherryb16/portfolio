## Recent Highlights

- Built the ShadowRock receivables cockpit and reusable analytics templates so consultants can keep clients informed fast.
- Organized a 4-person product pod for Rags to Robes, aligning hundreds of community resources to the people who need them.
- Led peak-season logistics at Storage Scholars, shipping 50+ moves on time while boosting efficiency by 30%.

## How I Work

- **Obsess over clarity**: I start with the decision to be made, then craft the dashboards, workflows, or UX needed to make it obvious.
- **Prototype in the open**: Stakeholders see progress earlyâ€”whether it's a FigJam map, Firebase build, or ops playbook.
- **Ground strategy in operations**: Field time with users, associates, and managers shapes every roadmap and metric.

## Let's Connect

If you're wrestling with disconnected systems, unclear metrics, or a service experience that needs a rethink, I'd love to compare notes.
