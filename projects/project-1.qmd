## Overview

ShadowRock partners with mid-market companies who need better visibility into their marketing, revenue, and operations data. I joined as the analytics builder tasked with creating reusable data infrastructure that kept client identities confidential while giving consultants the answers they needed fast.

## Objectives

- Consolidate Salesforce, HubSpot, Google Ads, and product data into a governed BigQuery environment for client engagements
- Ship modular dashboard templates so project teams could tailor insights without rebuilding SQL every time
- Provide leadership with a real-time receivables view to manage billing and cash flow across active projects

## What I Delivered

- **Client analytics workspace** – BigQuery pipelines that ingest and normalize data from six platforms, with semantic layers consultants can query for each anonymous client
- **Reusable dashboards** – Component libraries and visualization templates (Looker Studio + Salesforce dashboards) that accelerate weekly executive readouts and ad-hoc analyses
- **Data quality framework** – Automated freshness checks, documentation, and alerting so every deliverable hits the same standard regardless of who is on the project
- **Receivables cockpit** – Internal dashboard inside Salesforce that highlights overdue invoices, aging schedules, and owner follow-ups

## Impact

- Consulting teams now assemble engagement dashboards in hours instead of days, keeping client delivery on pace with question volume
- ShadowRock leadership monitors outstanding invoices and collections in one place, tightening billing conversations without spreadsheets
- The firm reuses one analytics foundation across multiple unnamed clients, protecting confidentiality while scaling insight

## Toolkit

- Google BigQuery, Cloud Functions, dbt-style SQL modeling  
- Salesforce dashboards & Lightning App Builder  
- Looker Studio visualization templates  
- Notion + Loom runbooks for enablement

## Next Iteration

I'm layering scenario modeling and sandbox datasets on top of the warehouse so consultants can prototype advanced forecasts before the next client workshop.
