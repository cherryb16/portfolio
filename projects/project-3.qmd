## Overview

ASARCO operates complex mining facilities where a missed shift can ripple through production. HR leaders asked me to help them get ahead of turnover and skill gaps by building dashboards that combined performance, retention, and training data in one view.

## Goals

- Reveal early-warning signals for attrition so managers can intervene before talent walks out the door
- Replace manual spreadsheets with automated reporting to save time and improve accuracy across plants
- Grow data confidence among frontline leaders so insights actually shape staffing and development conversations

## Solution

- Partnered with HR, safety, and plant managers to define the metrics that truly signaled riskâ€”including tenure cohorts, certification status, and absenteeism trends
- Built Power BI and Tableau dashboards with drill-through views from site-level heatmaps down to individual associates
- Automated recurring reports via Microsoft Power Platform, returning 20+ hours per month to HR analysts
- Delivered live workshops for 30+ managers and associates, leveling up their ability to explore data and act on what they found

## Impact

- Plants saw a 25% reduction in performance gaps and turnover once leaders could spot issues early and coordinate coaching plans
- HR shifted from reactive report-building to proactive talent planning, aligning hiring pipelines with actual demand
- Managers now arrive at standups with a shared dashboard, shortening status updates and focusing discussion on interventions

## Toolkit

- Microsoft Power BI & Tableau  
- Power Automate and Power Apps for workflow automation  
- Excel modeling for scenario planning  
- SharePoint and Teams for knowledge sharing

## Lessons Learned

When insights touch people decisions, adoption is everything. Bringing managers into the build, co-authoring definitions, and teaching the tooling ensured the dashboards became part of ASARCO's management rhythm.
