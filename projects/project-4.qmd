## Overview

Storage Scholars is a Shark Tank company backed by Mark Cuban that provides college student storage solutions during semester transitions. As Operations Manager in Tucson, I led the complete operational lifecycle for 50+ storage moves while managing a 6-person team during the high-pressure peak season.

## Challenge

- **Revenue pressure**: Drive significant revenue growth while optimizing operational costs and efficiency

## Solution & Approach
