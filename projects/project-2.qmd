## Overview

Rags to Robes is a Ballard Center initiative dedicated to helping Utah County residents break cycles of poverty. The director team needed a simple way to match individuals with local churches, nonprofits, and coaches ready to help. I joined as a partner liaison and product intern to design the first digital bridge.

## Challenge

- Community leaders juggled spreadsheets, texts, and email to track who needed what support.
- Families struggled to understand which services were actionable and culturally aligned.
- The initiative wanted to scale beyond pilot wards without overwhelming volunteers.

## Product Approach

- Conducted discovery interviews with church leaders, social workers, and families to understand the decision points in seeking aid.
- Designed a lightweight website and guided chatbot (no-code + custom scripts) that surfaces curated next steps based on a few key questions.
- Built a resource map of 30+ organizations, tagging each with services, eligibility, and response time to expose gaps and overlaps.
- Facilitated weekly design sprints with a four-person pod to iterate on flows, language, and volunteer onboarding.

## Results

- Hundreds of residents now access a single entry point that routes them to housing, employment, and counseling support tailored to their situation.
- Partner organizations gained visibility into where families stall, allowing targeted follow-up and shared accountability.
- The Ballard Center team now has a documented playbook to replicate the model in neighboring communities.

## My Role

I owned user research, service blueprinting, and the initial build. I also coached stakeholders on maintaining the content library and measuring engagement through no-code analytics.

## Stack & Tools

- Softr + Airtable for website scaffolding
- Custom prompt flows for the chatbot experience
- Miro, FigJam, and Notion for maps and documentation
- Zapier automations feeding partner notifications

## What’s Next

We’re piloting deeper data sharing agreements with partner organizations and layering in outcome tracking so we can quantify long-term impact for families.
