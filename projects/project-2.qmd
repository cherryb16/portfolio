## Overview

Rags to Robes is a Ballard Center initiative dedicated to helping Utah County residents break cycles of poverty. The director team needed a digital platform to connect individuals with local churches, nonprofits, and coaches. I joined as a partner liaison and product intern to build their first website.

## Challenge

- Community leaders juggled spreadsheets, texts, and email to track who needed what support
- Families struggled to understand which services were actionable and culturally aligned
- The initiative wanted to scale beyond pilot wards without overwhelming volunteers

## Product Approach

- **User Research**: Conducted discovery interviews with church leaders, social workers, and families to understand the decision points in seeking aid
- **Website Development**: Built a multi-page website with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript using Tailwind CSS for styling
- **Resource Organization**: Created structured pages for community events, leadership training, and emergency resources
- **Team Leadership**: Facilitated weekly design sprints with a four-person pod to iterate on flows, language, and volunteer onboarding
- **Resource Mapping**: Mapped 30+ local organizations to expose service gaps and inform strategy

## What I Built

- **Homepage**: Main landing page with navigation and overview
- **Community Calendar**: Page for tracking community events and activities
- **Leadership Training**: Resource page for training materials and programs
- **Emergency Resources**: Comprehensive resource directory with tooltips and contact information
- **Basic Interactivity**: JavaScript for UI enhancements and page functionality

## Results

- Created a centralized digital presence for the Rags to Robes initiative
- Partner organizations gained visibility into available resources and support pathways
- The Ballard Center team had a foundation to build upon for future development

## My Role

I owned user research, basic web development, and stakeholder coordination. While the implementation was relatively simple, it provided valuable experience in building for social impact and working with community organizations.

## Technical Implementation

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript with Tailwind CSS framework
- **Structure**: Multi-page website with navigation and resource organization
- **Styling**: Responsive design with hover effects and basic animations
- **Tools**: VS Code, Git for version control, and basic web hosting

## What’s Next

We’re piloting deeper data sharing agreements with partner organizations and layering in outcome tracking so we can quantify long-term impact for families.
